# Interpretable-Machine-Learning-for-Allergic-Rhinitis-Prediction
This repository record all the code we use for our paper titled "Interpretable Machine Learning for Allergic Rhinitis Prediction Among preschool children in Urumqi, China". In such a way, enhancing the transparency of this paper, enabling others to scrutinize the methods used and identify potential flaws or areas for improvement.

Rhinitis_upload.R: The main code section of the model

func_.R: The custom function, which is a condensation of redundant code, has three pieces of code where we only show the frame structure of the function because of the validity of the future work involved:
    1. get_mlDataDivide function
    2. get_UnitModelPerf function
    3. get_UnitModelPerf function
